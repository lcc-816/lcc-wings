65816 backend for LCC compiler
------------------------------
Jolse Maginnis

INSTALLATION FOR LINUX
----------------------

If you're reading this, then you should have untarred:

" tar zxvf lcc65816.tar.gz "

In the lcc dir, so it overwrites some of the original files.

The 65816 backend is in mips.md, overwriting the mips backend but who cares!
:) Some small kludges where needed in gen.c to get the 65816 version
working, so that also is included..

----------------
     NOTE!
----------------

Before you start, make sure you've got the Jos source and have compiled "ja" and
"ld65", (the assembler and the linker). To do this, run "make" in the jos/btools
directory of the Jos source. This will also prepare the "ja" config file
"$(HOME)/.ja", which contains the system include dir.

If you'd like to install the binaries somewhere else as well (E.g. somewhere in
your PATH), edit the jos/btools/Makefile and change BINDIR to where you'd like
to install them. Then run "make install".

----------------

Now you need to choose where you want the lcc output files to go.
I've chosen to make it $(HOME)/lcc/output
E.g. My lcc source is located at $(HOME)/lcc

If you'd like to put the build files somewhere else, edit BUILDDIR in the
Makefile.

Now you are ready to compile the compiler! First of all the pre-processor:

" make cpp "

then the compiler proper:

" make rcc "

Then finally it is time to make the compiler driver (in etc/), but before you do so you need to edit scpu.c, and change the #define's to point to the correct locations:

LCCDIR - The same as BUILDDIR
JOSDIR - The location of the Jos source

Then:

"make scpu"

Then edit the Makefile and change BINDIR to a directory in your path. 
E.g. $(HOME)/bin

then..

"make install"

Now "lcc" should be ready to roll!
